# Bitly url shorterer

The project is needed to create short links and record transitions on them.

### How to install

To create short links you need to get a token on the site [bit.ly](https://bit.ly/). The token looks like a string like the following: `17c09e20ad155405123ac1977542fecf00231da7` . Bitly offers several types of tokens. You need GENERIC ACCESS TOKEN.

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to start

Enter the following in the command line: `python main.py  [link]`



### Project Goals
